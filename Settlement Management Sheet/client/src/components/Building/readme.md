Buildings in Eclorean Ledger

Overview

Buildings are player-driven elements within Eclorean Ledger that provide mechanical and narrative depth to settlements. They directly influence Attributes, unlock player actions, expose Hook-Outs, and serve as critical decision-making tools for storytelling. Buildings are designed to be modular, allowing for upgrades, interactions with events, and thematic integration into the campaign world.

Core Properties

Buildings possess three fundamental properties that define their mechanical behavior:

1. Health

Represents the building’s structural integrity.

Default: 100%.

Impacts:

Buildings with reduced Health may lose functionality or bonuses.

Can be damaged by events, weather, or neglect.

Repairs require Labor Pool and Supplies.

2. Complexity

Governs the resource intensity of repairs and upgrades.

High Complexity increases repair costs.

Examples:

A Wizard Tower might have high Complexity due to intricate construction requirements.

A Storage Shed might have low Complexity.

3. Toughness

Determines resistance to damage from external forces.

High Toughness reduces the impact of damaging events.

Examples:

Stone Walls have high Toughness, minimizing weather or attack-related damage.

Wooden Palisades have low Toughness, making them more vulnerable.

Bonuses and Player Actions

Attribute Bonuses

Buildings can provide flat bonuses to Attributes, which scale with upgrades.

Example:

A Level 1 Granary adds +1 Food Bonus.

Higher levels provide greater bonuses (e.g., +5 Food Bonus at Level 3).

Unlockable Player Actions

Buildings can unlock unique player actions that create strategic opportunities:

Granary Example:

Action: Harvest

Cost: -2 Labor Pool

Effect: +10 Food, -2 Food Bonus for 3 turns (simulates an early harvest).

Walls Example:

Action: Fortify

Cost: -5 Supplies

Effect: +3 Toughness for 2 turns (boosts defenses temporarily).

Upgrades and Branching Paths

Upgrade Mechanics

Buildings can evolve into more specialized or powerful forms:

Path Options:

Example: A Granary can branch into:

Cold Storage: Increases Food Bonus and reduces spoilage events.

Ox-Pulled Carts: Unlocks the Harvest Action.

Costs and Trade-Offs:

Upgrades may require rare resources or introduce mutually exclusive paths.

Example: Stone Walls increase Toughness but raise Complexity, making repairs costlier.

Event and Hook-Out Integration

Hook-Outs Exposed by Buildings

Buildings dynamically interact with the narrative by exposing Hook-Outs:

Construction:

Example: Completing a Granary exposes granaryConstructed, enabling agricultural-themed events.

Upgrades:

Example: Upgrading Walls to Stone exposes stoneWallUpgrade, signaling a defensive milestone.

Damage or Destruction:

Example: A storm damages a Guard Tower, exposing guardTowerDamaged.

Interplay with Listener Packs

Generalized Listener Packs use these Hook-Outs to tie buildings into the broader narrative:

Example:

The Crumbling Infrastructure Pack reacts to guardTowerDamaged, queuing events about weakened defenses or sabotage.

The Temple Pilgrimage Pack reacts to templeConstructed, introducing pilgrims and potential social tension.

Scalability and Replayability

Scaling with Settlement Size

Bonuses and actions scale with settlement growth:

Example: A small settlement benefits significantly from +1 Food Bonus, while larger settlements require higher-level buildings for meaningful impact.

Replayability Through Choices

Different building paths and Hook-Out interactions ensure no two campaigns feel the same.

Player choices about what to build, upgrade, or repair create dynamic and varied storylines.

Narrative Role

Buildings are tools for players to shape the settlement’s narrative and mechanics:

Collaborative Storytelling:

Players vote on building priorities, upgrades, and repairs.

Dynamic Consequences:

Buildings introduce stakes and tensions by tying into events and NPC reactions.

Example: Protecting a Granary during a storm delays Wall construction, causing NPC unrest.

Summary

Buildings in Eclorean Ledger:

Provide mechanical bonuses to Attributes and unlock strategic player actions.

Expose Hook-Outs to dynamically integrate with Listener Packs and events.

Scale with settlement growth, offering replayability and thematic depth.

Act as tools for collaborative decision-making and emergent storytelling.

With their integration into the broader system, buildings are a cornerstone of player-driven gameplay, seamlessly tying mechanics and narrative together.
